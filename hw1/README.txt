Time spent: probably about 3 hours, almost entirely on the teardown part of the
assignment. This is because

a) I could not figure out how to get the Linksys E3000 router that I started with
apart. It has four screws, with heads that I fortunately had the right tool for
(similar, but not identical to, Torx screws). I took those out but could not determine
how to take the two halves apart. I could not find a teardown page or video on this
device, so I gave up (because I didn't want to break it).

b) I then tried to disassemble a PIC-based r/c airplane battery charger that I have, 
but the LCD display is soldered over the area where the uC and most of the other chips
are, and I didn't want to try to de-solder the display, as I would like to use the 
charger again ;^) .

c) the blood pressure monitor that I then disassembled has what is probably an
ASIC under a round lump of black plastic, so I could not determine what it is.

I finally resorted to the micro-oscilloscope that I have for my teardown, as
documented in the hw1.txt file.
